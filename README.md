# Mobile App Testing  

This section is dedicated to testing the mobile application [Shopping List](https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/pub/i/ef0e71eeb4f2d6a5),  
which allows the user to create a task list for organizing and managing daily tasks.  
Here I also present my practical work with Charles Proxy and the mobile version of the application [demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/).

I prepared the following documentation and completed the tasks:

- [Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oknIs1uv_NbOW3kgTo9LSVjsWVH7TMnxaEPHuvPNLw4/edit?usp=sharing) - a list of high-level checks, including both documentation-based testing and mobile-specific testing.
- [Test Cases via QASE](https://github.com/alevtinasemeniuk/mobile/blob/main/Test%20Cases_Mobile%20App%20Testing.pdf) - detailed checks of the mobile application.
- [Test Run_via QASE](https://github.com/alevtinasemeniuk/mobile/blob/main/Test%20Run_Mobile%20App%20Testing.pdf) - executing test cases to identify defects and assess the quality of the product. 
- [Bug Reports via YouTrack](https://github.com/alevtinasemeniuk/mobile/blob/main/Bug%20Reports_Mobile%20App%20Testing.xlsx) - documentation and registration of identified defects. 
- [Test Result Report](https://github.com/alevtinasemeniuk/mobile/blob/main/Test%20Result%20Report_Mobile%20App_Shopping%20List.docx) - providing comprehensive information about the results of the application testing, including metrics such as the number of bugs found, their percentage distribution across application modules, bug severity, and conclusions about the quality of the tested application.
